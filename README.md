deCode Africa
-------------
<p>De-Code Africa allows users to find out more about Africa through an interactive interface that overlays any country on Africa for comparison, to shed light on the true size of the under-reported continent. Anurag Kapur, a digital engineer at News International, Tom Woolway from Twitter, Andrew Mugoya from Asilia Creative, Anibe Agamah from The Telegraph, and Felix Greaves, a public health registrar at the NHS and co-founder of Medicine Africa - an online learning platform that connects doctors from the continent - worked on the prototype.</p>
